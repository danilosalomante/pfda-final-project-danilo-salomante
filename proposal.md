# Image to Sprite Generator

## Repository
<https://github.com/danilosalomante/pfda-final-project-danilo-salomante>

## Description
My project will be able to take inputted images and convert them into pixelated images that could be used for games or animations. This relates to the concepts of image processing we went over during C07.

## Features
- Image Conversion
	- The program produces images and converts them to sprites of different sizes.
- Supports multiple sprite sizes
	- Allows for the selection of different sprite sizes, (8x8, 16x16, 32x32) and produces the selected size.
- Creation of Different Color Palletes.
	- Allows for the changing of the outputted image to a different color pallete.

## Challenges
- Allowing for a file system that allows multiple images to be inputted and having their sprites put into a respective folder.
- Creating the system for multiple sprite sizes that can be induvidually selected. 
- Proper conversion of colors to a specific pallete. 

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A program that correctly converts images to sprites of a specific size and corresponding pallete, and can pick from multiple source images.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A program that can convert a single image to a desired size and pallete.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Create main function.
  2. Outline/Psuedocode different required functions.

- Week 2
  1. Create file handling system.
  2. Create image conversion function.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Create pallete converter for different sprite sizes.
  2. Final changes & testing.
